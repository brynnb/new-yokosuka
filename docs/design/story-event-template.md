# Story event template

Story events combine readable, authored progression with original game assets.
Walkthroughs and gameplay footage establish the important sequence; decoded
characters, motion, dialogue, voices and cameras supply the presentation.
The server decides eligibility and saves the outcome. Playing the original
Dreamcast room controller is not a prerequisite.

The template is a content specification, not a new executable format.
Implement events through the existing server/Yarn system and shared scene
player, rather than introducing another quest engine or renderer.

## Reusable template

Give each event a stable ID, a readable name, and its game and play mode. Copy
these fields for each event; write `none` when a field does not apply.

| Field | What to specify |
| --- | --- |
| Location | Zone, room and the part of that space used by the event. |
| Prerequisites | Required progress, items, character, personal date or time. |
| Trigger | Crossing an area, approaching someone, interacting, or completing another event. |
| Player setup | Starting position and facing, alignment, and controls to lock. |
| Characters | Who appears, their positions, motions and personal visibility changes. |
| Props | Important objects, attachments, pickups and handovers. |
| Action sequence | Ordered actions and any branches or choices. |
| Dialogue | Speaker, subtitle and voice references; choices and their outcomes. |
| Timing | Start/end cues, waits and the events that advance the sequence. |
| Camera shots | Framing, targets, zoom, transitions and shot-change cues. |
| Weather and lighting | Broad weather, season and lighting settings, or preserve the current environment. |
| Audio | Music, important effects and ambient sound; when they start and stop. |
| Interactive challenge | None, QTE, fight or minigame; prompts, input windows and result branches. |
| Completion effects | Flags, notebook entries, rewards, personal clock and NPC changes. |
| Exit behavior | Final zone, position, facing, restored camera and controls. |
| Skip, failure and replay | Accepted endings, retry behavior, saved continuation and repeat policy. |

Tie timing to voice lines, animation markers and completed actions wherever
possible. A whole-scene timeout is a failure, not evidence of completion.
QTEs need explicit input windows and outcomes; a finished animation is not a
successful QTE.

Label original-data facts, walkthrough-backed facts and adaptation choices
separately. An unresolved coordinate or clip ID stays unassigned until a quick
placement or asset check; it is not a reason to reconstruct unrelated engine
systems. Approximate lighting, camera framing, gestures and effects explicitly.
Keep consequential outcomes and story order reliable.

## Ine-san first allowance

Event ID: `s1.jomo.first-allowance`.
Play mode: personal Story mode, as Ryo. The personal-story worktree implements
this as a local prototype using the server's official Yarn import
`jomo-first-allowance` and the shared `first-allowance` scene package.

Rendered tests cover natural completion, X-skip, the earned notebook page and
reload without replay or another payment. The source presentation retains the
original camera, body motion and eleven voice lines. Money and door reference
actors currently have no rendered geometry, and separate hand/face callback
detail is not reconstructed. These are explicit prototype presentation limits.

The original event occurs after Ryo first leaves his bedroom. Ine-san gives him
¥500, explains the daily allowance and directs him to Fuku-san at the dojo.
The scene plays once; later daily allowance collection is a separate event.

### Event definition

The table below is the intended adaptation. Original asset and flag identities
are documented separately under [Original data](#original-data).

| Field | Event definition |
| --- | --- |
| Location | Shenmue I, Hazuki residence interior (`JOMO`), hallway outside Ryo's bedroom. |
| Prerequisites | Story mode; opening completed; this character's first-allowance milestone not completed; no other activity owns the player. No extra weather or exact-minute requirement. Use the saved personal calendar rather than the public clock. |
| Trigger | Cross the bedroom doorway into the hallway after the opening. The prototype uses a small authored activation area on the hall side of the existing bedroom door (`dor7`), not a door-click trigger. Its bounds are stored in the shared story-region catalog and tested with rendered hallway entry. |
| Player setup | Use the current Story-mode Ryo. Lock gameplay movement and interactions; align him to a nearby safe hall position facing Ine-san. Pause the personal clock for the scene and resume it afterward. |
| Characters | Ryo (`AKIR`) and Ine-san (`INE_`). Stage only this player's actors; suppress their overlapping ambient copies locally. Fuku-san is mentioned, not added to this scene. Restore normal personal NPC presentation afterward. |
| Props | Depict the money handover with available original props and clips. A simple handover gesture is an acceptable declared approximation; no banknote physics is required. |
| Action sequence | Align the actors, exchange the greeting/rest concern, present the allowance handover, explain future collection, mention Fuku-san, then settle and restore gameplay. |
| Dialogue | Prefer the original `01KOZ` subtitles and voices. The beats above describe the conversation, not replacement dialogue or invented voice IDs. No branching choice is needed. |
| Timing | Advance dialogue and shots using the actual line/clip cues. Complete the handover action before finishing the scene. Do not grant money when an arbitrary timer expires. |
| Camera shots | Reuse decoded scene cameras if readily usable. Otherwise author a medium two-shot, speaker-facing shots and a brief handover view. These replacement shots are approximations; exact transforms and clip cues need a staging check. |
| Weather and lighting | Preserve the personal season/weather outside and ordinary house lighting. No forced rain, snow, sun angle or exact particle timing. The fresh opening's morning calendar supplies the initial mood; do not reset the date on a delayed trigger. |
| Audio | Use the original voices and available scene effects. Keep ordinary interior ambience; duck conflicting background audio during speech and restore it on exit. Do not invent an original music ID. |
| Interactive challenge | None. This is a conversation/cutscene, not a QTE, fight or minigame. |
| Completion effects | Atomically mark the one-time milestone, grant ¥500, add the two notebook notes below, apply the reviewed native compatibility write, and record this personal date as already paid. No inventory item, date jump or immediate second daily payment. |
| Exit behavior | Remain in `JOMO` at the safe final hall position. Restore the player's previous camera mode and controls after cleanup. The next objective is speaking to Fuku-san at the dojo; do not teleport the player there. |
| Skip, failure and replay | An explicit skip after the server authorizes the scene counts as completion and settles the same effects once. Cancellation, preparation failure and timeout settle nothing and allow retry. Reconnect reads the server receipt: a committed scene stays completed even if its reply was lost. A completed scene does not automatically replay. |

The one-time milestone uses the existing personal script-state store; its name
is a proposed content identifier, not a new save system. The server must deduplicate
the event settlement so retries cannot pay twice. Future daily collection should
use the personal story date and the same payment record, separately from this
opening conversation.

### Notebook additions

Append one stable page after the opening pages, with two lightly adapted notes:

- Ine-san leaves ¥500 on the shoe cabinet each day.
- Visit Fuku-san at the dojo.

The page is unlocked only by the durable completion receipt and is not appended
again on reconnect or replay. Force Vector's
[notebook transcription](https://www.neoseeker.com/shenmue/faqs/45817-notebook.html)
places these facts immediately after the starting notes.

### Original data

The [first-allowance evidence](storyline-gameplay.md#original-first-allowance-evidence)
identifies the original event owner `0x60fe8`, its `01KOZ` resource request at
`0x610c6`, and activity `35` at `0x611b2` in Disc 1 JOMO `MAPINFO.BIN`.
The [Japanization guide](https://shenmuesubs.sourceforge.net/howto/shenmue1/addons/S1_JPG_083.pdf)
also identifies `01KOZ` as the first-allowance dialogue archive.
These are source identities, not a claim that a playable allowance package
already exists.

That owner writes native bank 2 bit `832 = 1` at `0x61002`. Apply the reviewed
write with successful server settlement, rather than before presentation as
the original owner does. This timing change makes cancellation safe. Other
original initialization branches also write bit 832, so it must not replace the
new event's one-time milestone or be described as an exclusive allowance flag.

Opening completion owns native bit `2:961` and the bedroom arrival; do not grant
those prerequisites as a side effect of starting the allowance. Temporary room
fields, native STEP arithmetic and interaction-manager registration are not
eligibility requirements for this authored event.

### Gameplay acceptance

A fresh Ryo can finish or skip the opening, leave the bedroom, receive this
scene once, gain exactly ¥500 and read the new notebook page. Staying in the
bedroom does not trigger it. Reloading preserves completion, returning through
the doorway does not pay again, and a failed/cancelled preparation remains
retryable without changing money or notes. Free roam and other players remain
unaffected. The final camera, controls and NPC restoration require a rendered
gameplay check, not only a state test.

The focused rendered checks use a real isolated server/database and restored
local assets: set `NEW_YOKOSUKA_STORY_E2E=true` and run
`tests/e2e/first-allowance.spec.js` against that development URL. The two bounded
allowance variants mark the opening completed through the real API and reset
to the hallway to isolate natural completion and skip behavior.

The `fresh opening` variant instead creates a new Story-mode Ryo, loads all four
intro scenes and uses the normal X-skip for each. It checks that the server has
not recorded completion early, rejects an early gameplay connection, verifies
the actual bedside arrival and saved 08:55 handoff, then walks
through the bedroom doorway with normal input/collision and no hallway reset.
It waits for natural allowance completion, checks the one-time payment and
notebook page, and reloads to verify the saved avatar, position, controls and
absence of replay/payment. The test clicks the rendered door if it is closed;
an already-open door retains its pose. Source-program initialization, natural
timing of the four intros, audio fidelity and mid-event network loss are
separate checks, not claims made by this test. Do not run it against production.
